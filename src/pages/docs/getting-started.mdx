# Getting Started with Scrap Mechanic Modding

This guide will walk you through the basics of setting up your development environment and creating your first mod for Scrap Mechanic.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A copy of Scrap Mechanic installed on your computer
- Basic understanding of file structures and editing JSON files
- A text editor (we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Image editing software for textures (optional)
- Basic understanding of Lua programming (for advanced mods)

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Step 1: Find Your Scrap Mechanic Installation

First, you need to locate your Scrap Mechanic installation folder. By default, it's usually in:

- Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Scrap Mechanic`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Steam/steamapps/common/Scrap Mechanic`
- Linux: `~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Scrap Mechanic`

### Step 2: Create a Mod Folder Structure

Create a new folder for your mod in the game's `Survival/Mods/` directory with the following structure:

```
MyMod/
├── Objects/
│   └── Database/
│       └── ShapeSets/
├── Scripts/
├── description.json
└── preview.jpg
```

### Step 3: Create the Description File

The `description.json` file contains metadata about your mod. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "name": "My First Mod",
  "description": "A simple mod for Scrap Mechanic",
  "type": "Blocks and Parts",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "localId": "my-first-mod",
  "supports": ["0.5.0", "0.5.1"]
}
```

## Creating Simple Parts

### Custom Block Example

To create a simple custom block:

1. Create a new folder in `Objects/Database/ShapeSets` named after your block
2. Create a `block.json` file with the block properties
3. Add texture files for your block
4. Register your block in the game's database

Here's an example `block.json`:

```json
{
  "uuid": "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555",
  "name": "My Custom Block",
  "renderable": {
    "lodList": [
      {
        "mesh": "block.mesh",
        "subMeshList": [
          {
            "textureList": [
              "../textures/MyTexture.png"
            ],
            "material": "DifAsgNor"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "physics": {
    "box": {
      "x": 1.0,
      "y": 1.0,
      "z": 1.0
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing Your Mod

To test your mod:

1. Start Scrap Mechanic
2. Load a creative or survival game
3. Your mod should be automatically loaded if in the correct directory

## Next Steps

Once you've created your first basic mod, you might want to explore:

- [Item Creation](/docs/item-creation) - Learn how to create custom items
- [Lua Scripting](/docs/lua-scripting) - Add custom behaviors with Lua scripts
- [JSON Formatting](/docs/json-formatting) - Master the JSON format used by Scrap Mechanic

## Troubleshooting

If your mod isn't showing up:

- Double-check file paths and locations
- Verify JSON syntax (use a JSON validator)
- Check the game's log files for errors
- Make sure your mod supports the current game version
